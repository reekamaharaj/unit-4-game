                                You are out on an adventure and you have run low
                                on food and water. You look in your coin purse
                                only to find that you have nothing! You stop at
                                the first tavern you see and ask the owner how
                                much you would need for a decent meal. He says
                                that he would gift you lodging and food for the
                                night if you would do something for him. But its
                                a little tricky. You agree. <br/><br/>

                                The owner gives you a pouch. The pouch needs to
                                be filled with an exact amount of gems. Any
                                amount over and the pouch will disappear and all
                                gems will be lost! You will then have to come
                                back to the owner to get a new pouch and try
                                again with a new amount. <br/><br/>

                                The owner tells you that you can find four
                                different gems around town, but he isn't sure
                                how much each is worth.

                                At the start of the game a number will be shown. Click the picture of the crystals to add them to your pouch. You need to get your score to equal the number shown at the start of the game. If your score is more than the number, you will lose. Each crystal has a different value, which you will not know until you've clicked one. Every new game will change the number to match as well as the value of each crystal.
