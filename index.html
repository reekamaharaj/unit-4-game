            <p>You are out on an adventure and you have run low on food and water. You look in your coin purse only to find that you have nothing! You stop at the first tavern you see and ask the owner how much you would need for a decent meal. He says that he would gift you lodging and food for the night if you would do something for him. But its a little tricky. You agree. <br> <br>
    
            The owner gives you a pouch. The pouch needs to be filled with an exact amount of gems. Any amount over and the pouch will disappear and all gems will be lost! You will then have to come back to the owner to get a new pouch and try again with a new amount. <br> <br>
                
            The owner tells you that you can find four different gems around town, but he isn't sure how much each is worth. </p>

                <p class="text-sm"> At the start of the game a number will be shown.
                Click the picture of the crystals to add them to your pouch. You need to get your score to equal the number shown at the start of the game. If your score is more than the number, you will lose. 
            
                Each crystal has a different value, which you will not know until you've clicked one. 
            
                Every new game will change the number to match as well as the value of each crystal. </p>
