                    You are out on an adventure and you have run low
                    on food and water. You look in your coin purse
                    only to find that you have nothing! You stop at
                    the first tavern you see and ask the owner how
                    much you would need for a decent meal. He says
                    that he would gift you lodging and food for the
                    night if you would do something for him. But its
                    a little tricky. You agree. <br /><br />

                    The owner gives you a pouch. The pouch needs to
                    be filled with an exact amount of gems. Any
                    amount over and the pouch will disappear and all
                    gems will be lost! You will then have to come
                    back to the owner to get a new pouch and try
                    again with a new amount. <br /><br />

                    The owner tells you that you can find four
                    different gems around town, but he isn't sure
                    how much each is worth.

                        At the start of the game a number will be shown. Click the picture of the crystals to
                        add them to your pouch. You need to get your score to equal the number shown at the
                        start of the game. If your score is more than the number, you will lose. Each crystal
                        has a different value, which you will not know until you've clicked one. Every new game
                        will change the number to match as well as the value of each crystal.
